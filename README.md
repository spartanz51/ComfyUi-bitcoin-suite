# Bitcoin Suite - ComfyUi â‚¿

## A Node Suite for ComfyUI with Bitcoin Superpowers!

Turn any image, whether it's from your PC or generated by ComfyUi workflow, into a Bitcoin wallet! 
This project is all about the thrill of discovering Bitcoin wallet generation from images or ComfyUi workflows.

## Disclaimer

> Hey there! Just a quick heads-up, this project isn't intended to be a secure means of storing your Bitcoin private keys. After all, any DIY "mechanism" (like this repo) or attempt to beef up Bitcoin wallet security is a bit risky. So, only use this project for fun and to explore the world of custom comfy nodes and Bitcoin wallet generation. I can't be held responsible for any Bitcoin losses due to using this repo.
